# DetachedLightning
This is a SKSE plugin for Skyrim AE, SE, and VR that detaches lightning spell effects from their caster's hands.
As it was developed using [CommonLibSSE-NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG), it should be compatible with SE, AE (1.16.353), and VR. (VR has not been tested.)
Currently *does not* support AE 1.16.629, but it should be an easy update once CommonLibSSE-NG updates.
